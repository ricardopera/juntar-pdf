## Edge Cases and Failure Scenarios

### Edge Case Matrix

| Scenario | Expected Behavior | Error Handling |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| No files selected | Disable merge button | Show instruction message |
| Single file selected | Allow merge (no-op) | Process normally or show warning |
| Corrupted PDF file | Reject file | Display specific error message |
| Very large files (>50MB) | Reject or warn | File size limit message |
| Encrypted/password PDFs | Reject or prompt | Request password or skip file |
| Non-sequential page numbers | Process as-is | Maintain upload order |
| Memory limitations | Graceful degradation | Clear error with retry option |
| Browser compatibility | Fallback or error | Browser requirement message |

## Dependencies and Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- PDF manipulation library (PDF-lib or similar)
- Modern JavaScript ES6+ support
- File API support in browsers
- Local storage for temporary processing

### Constraints
- Client-side only processing
- No server backend required
- No user authentication needed
- No persistent storage required

### Risk Assessment
- **High**: Browser compatibility issues with PDF processing
- **Medium**: Memory limitations with large files
- **Low**: PDF format compatibility issues
